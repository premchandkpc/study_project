# Longest Substr No Repeat

## Quick Facts

- Area: DSA
- Tag: Sliding Window
- Source: `src/modules/topics/dsa/dsa-sw-longest-uniq.js`
- Tags: `sliding window`, `variable window`, `string`, `hashmap`, `frequency`
- Visual coverage: live visual

## Concept

Return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Pattern:** Variable sliding window + frequency map - O(n)
**Hint:** Expand right; when duplicate appears, move left until the window is valid again.
**Scenario:** Session-token scan - keep the longest contiguous clean segment.

## Why It Matters

Understanding this topic helps you build more efficient, reliable, and maintainable systems. It explains the practical impact of the design or algorithm in production.
## Architecture / Mental Model

  n1["Pattern choice"]
  n2["State structure"]
  n3["Loop/recursion"]
  n4["Answer"]
  n0 --> n1
  n1 --> n2
  n2 --> n3
  n3 --> n4
```

## Runtime / Sequence

```mermaid

  participant a0 as Problem input
  participant a1 as Pattern choice
  participant a2 as State structure
  participant a3 as Loop/recursion
  participant a4 as Answer
  a0->>a1: start
  a1->>a2: process
  a2->>a3: process
  a3->>a4: process
  a4-->>a3: result
  a3-->>a2: return
  a2-->>a1: return
  a1-->>a0: return
```

## Animation Plan

- Flow lab can use generated mental model steps above.
- UML sequence can use generated sequence diagram above.
- Architecture map can use generated area mental model above.
- Live visual exists in app: topic-specific canvas/ReactViz animation.

Flow steps:

1. Problem input
2. Pattern choice
3. State structure
4. Loop/recursion
5. Answer

## Example

Example code, configuration, or architecture depends on the concrete problem. Use the implementation in the linked source file as a starting point.
